In 2021, they announced their Avalanche Rush incentives program to introduce more applications and to promote further growth of their ecosystem. The Avalanche chain is centered around 3 main blockchains - the P-Chain, X-Chain and C-Chain. The C-Chain is Avalanche’s EVM implementation, which hosts various applications and smart contracts. Users can access Avalanche through centralized exchanges, the official Avalanche bridge or via Celer’s cBridge.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/325/small/Tether.png?1668148663', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/825/small/bnb-icon2_2x.png?1644979850', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6319/small/USD_Coin_icon.png?1547042389']",,2023-03-17T09:10:31.610Z

Terra’s network token is LUNA which powers the entire ecosystem. Unlike most blockchains, Terra’s ecosystem includes a native algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). A decentralized network with its own decentralized currency is a very attractive thesis for both users and developers. More dApps are being built on Terra, especially DeFi protocols which are now commonly known as TeFi.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8284/small/01_LunaClassic_color.png?1653547790', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12681/small/UST.png?1653548090', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3246/small/Nash_M.png?1680864855']",,2023-03-17T09:10:32.057Z
103,solana-ecosystem,Solana Ecosystem,,,"Solana is a general purpose blockchain similar to Ethereum. The underlying architecture is different, such that developers have to write applications using Rust instead of Solidity or Vyper. However, this may soon change with the introduction of the Neon EVM solution on Solana. End user applications as of now include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), marketplaces, games, and more. One of its biggest features is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which is spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research. The first use case for DeFi applications on Solana is Serum, built by the team behind FTX.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/325/small/Tether.png?1668148663', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6319/small/USD_Coin_icon.png?1547042389', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4128/small/solana.png?1640133422']",,2023-03-17T09:10:31.171Z

Besides parachains, projects can participate in the Polkadot ecosystem for a shorter fixed period of time through parathreads. Blockchains built on top of Polkadot’s own relay chain are also interoperable with blockchains that have vastly different technology stacks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin through bridges.","['https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12171/small/polkadot.png?1639712644', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/877/small/chainlink-new-logo.png?1547034700', 'https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/22617/small/astr.png?1642314057']",,2023-03-17T09:10:37.149Z

Compared to Ethereum which would usually cost hundreds to make a few transactions, BNB only charges less than a few dollars.
